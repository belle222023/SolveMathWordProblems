        Welcome to the official site of <strong>Jerry Knoelke</strong> — educator, mathematician, and author of
        <em>Math Is Not Magic: Solve Your Math Word Problems</em>. Jerry believes that every student can learn logic and
        understand math deeply when given a consistent visual routine.

        <strong>Math Is Not Magic: Solve Your Math Word Problems</strong> is written to show that logic, not magic, drives learning. When neuroscience found that one consistent routine needs to be provided to reach the adolescent mind — and no one was doing this — Jerry stepped in to provide it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book helps students visualize math word problems as puzzles they can see and solve. Through a clear and repeatable method, Jerry demonstrates that math isn’t about tricks — it’s about understanding how the brain naturally learns.

            Just imagine doing a child’s five piece jigsaw puzzle without seeing the pieces. If all you had to work with were the words describing the pieces it would be a complex challenge. But, if you see the pieces, it is just a simple child’s puzzle. It is the same with Math word problems. PRESS shows you how to make your Math word problem simplify to a child’s puzzle you can see for your mind to solve.
