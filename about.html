        <h3>My Inspiration for Writing <em>Math Is Not Magic</em></h3>
        <p>Jerry wants a better future for tomorrow’s people. Neuroscience has discovered that the part of the brain used for analyzing abstract thoughts, i.e. word problems, does not mature in the average person until their mid to late twenties.</p>
        <p>The average student’s Math brain is not yet physically developed enough to build a study path by itself. Neuroscience recommends we provide one consistent routine to the average student and stop leaving them lost by today’s multiple methods. No one has addressed this, so Jerry wrote <em>Math Is Not Magic</em>. Jerry’s goal is to stop seeing blank looking eyes in Math class (and later on in adults).</p>

            <h3>What Inspired Me</h3>
            <p>
              Jerry Knoelke would start out each school year by asking his students to define Math. Most had no concept of how to even describe Math. They thought of Math as something “Magical”. Jerry wants all students to grow and learn logic, not just the top ten percent! We need this.
